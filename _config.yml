  Hi, my name is Hoonseok Yoon and I'm a student from South Korea.

  A highly motivated and detail-oriented student specializing in Digital Healthcare at the College of Software and Digital Healthcare, with a strong foundation in software development, big data analysis, and AI applications. Possesses hands-on experience in developing software solutions and analyzing complex datasets to drive innovation in healthcare technologies. 

  I have actively participated in AI-driven medical research projects, focusing on deep learning applications in medical imaging, predictive modeling, and healthcare data analytics. My experience includes developing ML models for age prediction, disease detection, and medical image segmentation using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, including CNNs, LSTMs, and generative AI. 

  Beyond academics and research, I am deeply passionate about exploring innovative ways to bridge the gap between AI and practical healthcare applications. I enjoy tackling challenging problems, experimenting with new AI models, and leveraging data-driven insights to improve healthcare solutions. 

  Outside of work and studies, I have a strong passion for sports, including soccer and golf. I also love driving and listening to music, which helps me relax and stay inspired. These hobbies allow me to maintain a balanced and creative mindset while continuously pushing myself to achieve new goals.
